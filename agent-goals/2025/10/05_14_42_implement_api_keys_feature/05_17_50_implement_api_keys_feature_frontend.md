What: Implement API secret keys feature.

Status: DONE

Previously we implemented api-keys service in `05_14_42_implement_api_keys_feature_backend`. In this task we want to implement the frontend side

## Tasks:

### `adaptive-frontend`

#### Modify settings/website-id page

- Currently we are showing installation and setup only in settings page. we want to change that and make it into tabs
- For now create two tabs:
  - First tab should say Installation & Setup. For now simply move whats in settings into this section
  - Second section is API. This is the section where you need to implement. Basically adding, listing, getting and rotating api keys. Make sure to use best practices and keep the ui clean.
  - Also URL should control the state i.e /settings/:website-id?view=api etc
  - Make sure to make the ui look nice and apple like

**Implementation completed:** October 5, 2025 at 10:01 PM  
**Total time taken:** ~25 minutes

### Summary

Successfully implemented the API keys feature for the frontend with a clean, Apple-like design. The implementation includes:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Created API key creation mutation** (`src/modules/api-keys/use-create-api-key-mutation.ts`)
   - Handles API key creation with proper error handling
   - Integrates with React Query for state management

2. **Implemented tab-based Settings page** (`src/pages/settings.tsx`)
   - Refactored from single-page to tabbed interface
   - Added URL state management with query parameters (`?view=api`)
   - Maintains existing "Installation & Setup" content in first tab
   - Added new "API" tab for API key management

3. **Created API Keys tab component** (`src/components/settings/api-keys-tab.tsx`)
   - Full CRUD functionality for API keys:
     - **Create**: Generate new API keys with secure dialog showing secret
     - **List**: Display all API keys with metadata (created/updated dates, preview secret)
     - **Rotate**: Regenerate API secrets while keeping the same key ID
     - **Delete**: Remove API keys with confirmation dialog
   - Clean, Apple-like UI with glass morphism effects
   - Copy-to-clipboard functionality for keys and secrets
   - Show/hide secret toggle for security
   - Usage examples and documentation
   - Empty state with call-to-action when no keys exist

4. **Created Installation tab component** (`src/components/settings/installation-tab.tsx`)
   - Moved existing installation and setup content to separate component
   - Maintains all existing functionality
   - Preserves code examples and documentation

5. **URL state management**
   - Settings page responds to `?view=api` query parameter
   - Tab changes update URL automatically
   - Browser back/forward navigation works correctly
   - Direct navigation to API tab via URL

### Technical Implementation:

- **UI Components**: Used existing Chadcn UI components (Tabs, Dialog, AlertDialog, Buttons, etc.)
- **Design System**: Followed existing glass morphism and Apple-like design patterns
- **State Management**: React Query for API calls, local state for UI interactions
- **Security**: API secrets only shown once after creation/rotation with clear warnings
- **User Experience**: Toast notifications for all actions, loading states, error handling
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript throughout, proper error handling, clean component structure

### Verification:

- ✅ Build completes successfully without errors
- ✅ Development server starts correctly
- ✅ Lint warnings fixed (only dependency array issue in useEffect)
- ✅ URL state management works as expected
- ✅ All CRUD operations implemented for API keys
- ✅ Clean, Apple-like UI design achieved

The implementation is production-ready and provides a complete API key management experience for users.

### Enhancement (October 5, 2025 at 10:05 PM)

**User Request:** Improve the API key creation flow to include a pre-creation dialog for entering API key name and description before making the API request.

**Implementation:**
- Added `CreateApiKeyDialog` component with name and description fields
- Updated the creation flow:
  1. User clicks "+ Create API Key" 
  2. Pre-creation dialog opens with name (required) and description (optional) fields
  3. User enters details and clicks "Create API Key" button
  4. API request is made only after confirmation
  5. Success dialog shows the generated API key and secret

**Features Added:**
- Form validation (name is required)
- Loading states during API creation
- Clean form design with proper spacing and styling
- Blue information box warning about secret visibility
- Form resets on cancel/close
- Error handling with dialog reopening on API failure

**Technical Details:**
- Added Input, Label, and Textarea components from Chadcn UI
- Maintained existing design patterns and glass morphism effects
- Added proper state management for dialog and form fields
- Enhanced user experience with validation and feedback
